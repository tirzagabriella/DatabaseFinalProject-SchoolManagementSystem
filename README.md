A school management system is a software application designed to streamline and automate various administrative tasks within an educational institution. It aims to enhance efficiency, organization, and communication among different users involved in the system. In this case, the system has three main users: SuperAdmin, Teacher, and Student. Overall, the school management system simplifies administrative tasks, enhances communication between different users, improves data management, and provides easy access to important information related to attendance, assignments, announcements, and user details.
